"""Post-verdict guard: pure functions that decide whether the LLM's verdict commits.

The guard fires only on deterministic edges; the ambiguous middle passes through:

- ``authz.class == contradicted`` caps a close at escalate — authorization records ARE
  present but fail to cover (expired, out-of-window, wrong scope, CAB-unapproved) or a
  prohibition forbids the action. The mismatch is the finding; a human responder is the
  right verifier. This is the engine's judgment enforced, not a keyword branch.
- malicious signal caps a close at escalate — the "authorization never overrides an
  IOC" sentence in the verdict prompt, promoted from instruction to enforcement.

``absent`` (no record of the right kind) deliberately does NOT override in this
increment: the verdict prompt already steers absent-evidence cases to needs_more_info
and the model is free to close on non-authorization grounds. Everything here is
side-effect free and unit-tested case-for-case, same discipline as the expectedness
parity test.
